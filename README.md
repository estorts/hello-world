# hello-world
This is my first repository

I have recently completed a masters program in economics.  

One of my last classes was one on machine learning inwhich we used a GUI interface.
Now I am exploring programming and coding to learn more about machine learning as well as doing it myself.

I am also interested in desktop app, mobile app, and web development.
